# Quantum Purse

A static web application functioning as a quantum-safe wallet for CKB blockchain. CKB addresses generated by Quantum Purse are quantum-safe, ensuring that assets transferred to these addresses remain secure against quantum threats.

###### Indexed DB store model
```
- Single encrypted master seedphrase
- Multiple encrypted SPHINCS+ key pairs
```

## Wallet recovery

When you import your seed phrase into QuantumPurse, it automatically restores your wallets by generating child keys sequentially, starting from index 0. The recovery process continues until it encounters 10 consecutive empty accounts (i.e., accounts with no transaction history). At that point, it is decided that the total number of recovered wallets will be equal to the highest index of a non-empty wallet plus one.

## How to use

The following are the recommended ways to use this software, ranked from most to least preferred:
1. Serve locally with webpack serve via command `npm run start` (**recommended**). You can find a bunch of other ways to serve the built dist/ folder locally too.
2. Though it is possible you can deploy this app on github pages and allow others to use via command `npm run deploy`, this is **not recommended**.

## Contribute
###### <u>Dependencies</u>
1. Rust and Cargo.
2. wasm-pack.
3. Docker Engine/Desktop (currently skipped).
4. Node ^20.

###### <u>Command list</u>

```shell
# Init git submodule
git submodule update --init

# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Run test
npm run test

# Run in development env
npm run start

# Build a production package
npm run build

# Deploy the web app to your github page
npm run deploy
```

## Notes

1. As of 2025, Quantum resistance is still experimental. Use this software at your own risk.
2. Back up your seed phrases. Losing them means losing access to your wallet.
3. Quantum Purse does NOT store your passwords. Passwords are used only temporarily to encrypt and decrypt your secret data.
4. IndexedDB stores only public data (e.g., SPHINCS+ public keys) and encrypted secret data. Your SPHINCS+ private keys remain protected.
5. Forgot your password? You can recover access by importing your seed phrase and setting a new password instantly.
6. Need help? If you encounter an issue, report it on GitHub or contact us on Telegram: @quantumpurse.
7. Nervos DAO are comming!

## Commentary

Quantum Purse is designed as a static web app that utilizes web browser's execution engine. This means there's no backend or server involved, only the software that runs in the browser. There're both pros and cons to this approach. The pros is that it shortens development time and can access multiple platforms as long as users have their web browser installed. The cons is that it is vulnerable to browser-based threats, such as malicious extensions, script injection, and other web-based attacks.

Quantum Purse requires users to enter their password for each transaction or key-related function. While the application ensures that sensitive data is securely erased (zeroized) after processing, the password input remains a potential attack vector. This is inherently the weakest link in all password-based cryptocurrency wallets.

Until a proper SPHINCS+ hardware wallet is available for secure key management, consider the following best practices to maximize security:

1. Use a dedicated device with minimal software(including web extension) installed to run Quantum Purse.
2. Terminate the web browser after completing a transaction. Ideally, power off your computer to ensure any residual passwords-related data in RAM is wiped.
3. For maximum security, use an air-gapped device (one with no internet connection) to run Quantum Purse. To sign a transaction:
  - Construct an unsigned transaction on a separate, internet-connected device, using your public address.
  - Transfer it via a secure USB drive (free from malware please ^^) to the air-gapped device.
  - Sign the transaction on the air-gapped device.
  - Transfer the signed transaction back via USB and broadcast it using a tool like [this one](https://explorer.nervos.org/tools/broadcast-tx). You might want to try the broadcaster with joyID signed transactions first ^^!
  - This effectively turns your dedicated device into a quantum-safe offline signer!

While Quantum Purse is currently not yet fine tuned for 3) - air-gapped usage, implementing such functionality would require minimal effort. If you're interested, open an issue to let me know what you need!
