# QuantumPurse

Quantum Purse is a quantum-safe wallet for the CKB blockchain, currently utilizing the SPHINCS+ signature scheme (now renamed to FIPS 205 by NIST) and the [CKB Quantum-Resistant Lock Script](https://github.com/cryptape/quantum-resistant-lock-script). It offers a comprehensive toolset for generating and importing BIP39-style mnemonic seed phrases, creating accounts, and signing CKB transactions (currently limited to transfers). The CKB addresses generated by Quantum Purse are quantum-safe, ensuring that assets transferred to these addresses remain secure against quantum threats.

#### Indexed DB store model

```
+---------------------------------+
|    seed_phrase_store(single)    |
+---------------------------------+
|  Key: "seed_phrase"             |
|  Value: CipherPayload           |
|        - salt: String           |
|        - iv: String             |
|        - cipher_text: String    |
+---------------------------------+


+---------------------------------+
|    child_keys_store(multiple)   |
+---------------------------------+
|  Key: pub_key (String)          |
|  Value: SphincsPlusKeyPair      |
|        - index: u32             |
|        - pub_key: String        |

## Use

The following are the recommended ways to use this software, ranked from most to least preferred:
1. run locally with `npm run start`
2. run `npm run deploy` to deploy it on your own GitHub page and allow others to use it.

## Notes

1. Quantum resistance is experimental. Use this software at your own risk.
2. Back up your seed phrases. Losing them means losing access to your wallet.
3. QuantumPurse does NOT store your passwords. Passwords are used only temporarily to encrypt and decrypt your secret data.
4. IndexedDB stores only public data (e.g., SPHINCS+ public keys) and encrypted secret data. Your private keys remain protected.
5. Forgot your password? You can recover access by importing your seed phrase and setting a new password instantly.
