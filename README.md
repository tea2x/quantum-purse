# QuantumPurse

Quantum Purse is a quantum-safe wallet for the CKB blockchain, currently utilizing the SPHINCS+ signature scheme and the [CKB Quantum-Resistant Lock Script](https://github.com/cryptape/quantum-resistant-lock-script), now renamed to FIPS 205 by NIST. It offers a comprehensive toolset for generating and importing BIP39-style mnemonic seed phrases, creating accounts, and signing CKB transactions (currently limited to transfers). The CKB addresses generated by Quantum Purse are quantum-safe, ensuring that assets transferred to these addresses remain secure against quantum threats.

1. run locally with `npm run start`
2. run `npm run deploy` to deploy it on your own GitHub page and allow others to use it.

## Notes

1. Backup your seedphrases.
2. QuantumPurse does NOT store your passwords.
3. Passwords are used on the fly to encrypt/decrypt secret data.
4. Indexed DB only maintain public data such as sphincs+ public keys, and encrypted secret data.
5. If you forget your password, you can only import your seedphrase and set a new password, on the fly.
6. If you encounter a problem using the wallet, open a github issue or contact this telegram handle **@quantumpurse**
